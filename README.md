# CS115-Final-Project
This was my CS115 final project, concerning Java and Object-Oriented Programming.
The final project was my first semester, freshman year project. It exposed me to creating constructors instantiating variables, 
using scanners for user input, creating new objects for classes, if/else statements, for/while loops, and many other beginner methods.
